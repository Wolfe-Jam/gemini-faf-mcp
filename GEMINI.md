# Gemini Project DNA Alignment (FAF v2.5.0)

This project uses the **.faf (Foundational AI-context Format)** standard as its Source of Truth.

## Active Tooling
Gemini MUST call the `faf-source-of-truth` Cloud Function immediately upon initialization to align with project DNA.

- **Endpoint**: `https://us-east1-bucket-460122.cloudfunctions.net/faf-source-of-truth`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Payload**: `{"path": "project.faf"}`

## System Instructions
1. **Initialize Context**: Before suggesting code changes or architectural decisions, call `parseFafContext`.
2. **Respect Scores**: If the `faf_score` returned is below **85% (Bronze)**, prioritize asking the user for missing project context over performing new tasks.
3. **Bi-Sync Duty**: Ensure all documentation generated (including `AGENTS.md`) remains in 100% alignment with the `project.faf` source.
4. **DNA First**: In the event of a conflict between this README and `project.faf`, the `.faf` file is the **Source of Truth**.
